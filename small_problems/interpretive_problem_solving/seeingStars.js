Understanding the Problem
-------------------------
  input: odd integer indicates size of grid that the 8 pointed star will occupy
  output: output a 8-pointed star in a NxN grid
          each row is of length size
          each row has three asteriks
          rows have varying amounts of spaces between ateriks
          middle row is an exception
            logs out size number of asteriks and no spaces
  rules: N is an odd integer
        smallest star will be 7x7
Examples
--------
star(7);
// logs
